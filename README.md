# Timer for Harvest
[Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) client implemented using
[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for Linux
and the various BSD's.

## Installation
On the Timer for Harvest github page, click on the 
[releases link](https://github.com/frenkel/timer-for-harvest/releases). The 
newest release is listed at the top of the page. It contains pre-build 
binaries for Ubuntu 20.04 and Fedora 32, as well as other distributions. 
You will be notified of new releases by a message in the main window.

## Usage
After installation your GNOME shell should be able to find the
application when you type "Timer for Harvest" in the activity searcher.

### First usage
Upon first launch you will first see a web browser start. This will open an
authorization flow from Harvest. When you've completed these steps you will
end up on a white page with the text "Authorized successfully." The actual
application will start now.

### Daily usage
Just like the Harvest web interface there are some handy keyboard shortcuts:
- **F5** in the main window will refresh the time entries list. This can be
  usefull when you updated the entries using a different interface and
  Timer for Harvest still shows the old state.
- **N** in the main window opens the new time entry popup.
- **Esc** closes the time entry popup.
- **Enter** activates the "Save Timer" button in the time entry popup.

## Security
Username and password details are never seen by Timer for Harvest. A web
browser is used to authorize Timer for Harvest access to your account. This
authorization is stored in the form of an authorization token, which Harvest
lets expire in 14 days. Leaking this token would thus give somebody access to
your account for a maximum of 14 days.

The authorization token is currently stored on the file system, namely in
$XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/timer-for-harvest.json. In the future we hope to move this
token to a more secure location, such as
[libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret).

## Wishlist
- Idle detection to ask user whether idle time should be subtracted or booked
  as a new time entry. For example, using this dbus call when using GNOME:
  `dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor /org/gnome/Mutter/IdleMonitor/Core org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor.GetIdletime`
- Authentication token storage in [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret).
- [Improve UI](https://github.com/frenkel/timer-for-harvest/issues/34) to speed up the new entry process.

## Building
If you want to build the applicatin yourself you'll need rust, cargo and the gtk3
development libraries installed. You can then run `cargo build --release` to generate
the binary in `target/release/`.
